# Hackintosh-Opencore-GT-1030-Montery

Note:
1. Should use BigSur instead GT 1030
2. Use OCLP (Opencore patcher) to force web driver. Use version v0.4.x. Don't need fake system version!!
3. Some apps like Zoom, Chrome need Camera, Microphone permissions. We need https://github.com/jslegendre/tccplus to add permission manually!>
